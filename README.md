# FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a classic coding interview question that is often used to assess a candidate's basic programming skills and logical reasoning. The problem is typically stated as follows:

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead. For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Here's an example of the expected output:
~~~
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
...
~~~

Here I compare the benchmark of a basic and direct approach to a advanced, sophisticated and generic approach.
